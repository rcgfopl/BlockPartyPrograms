Here is our code we use for our robot, freshly pulled from our Git repository. Here are the files:

SmoothAuto_Chooser.c:
    This program allows us to choose our autonomous program to run in a
    streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly way, helping us to avoid
    costly errors in configuring our autonomous before the match. It also
    contains all our autonomous programs.

SmoothAutoLibrary.c:
    This library is used by our autonomous programs to make our code
    less redundant and more readable. All these functions are made by
    our team.

Comp_TeleOp_RCGFoPL.c:
    This contains our tele-op program that we use during the tele-op
    phase. Apart from the standard functionality of translating joystick
    input into robot movement, our tele-op program includes many unique,
    innovative features to streamline our robot driving experience, such
    as buttons to automate commonly performed actions and increase robot
    movement precision by scaling down motor movement.

FunctionLibrary.c:
    This library contains many functions used between all our team's
    programs. Every function in this library is designed and created by
    our team.
